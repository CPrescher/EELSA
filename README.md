# EELSA

A Matlab gui program for analyzing Electron Energy Loss Spectra (EELS). 
It was specifically developped for extracting Fe3+/Fe_total ratios.

I have written this software during my PhD. It is currently still in use in BGI.

In case you want to use it, need an executable (e.g. no matlab license) or have any other questions please, please contact me (clemens.prescher@gmail.com)

to run the software just run:

eels_gui

in the matlab commandline.
